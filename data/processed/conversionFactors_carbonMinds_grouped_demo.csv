All relevant production steps within the chemical industry are modeled based on representative data on the production technology used in individual plants along the supply chain, with data coverage ranging from 95% to 100% of global production capacities. The production of crude oil, naphtha and natural gas is covered on the basis of representative data at country level or at a larger regional level.
